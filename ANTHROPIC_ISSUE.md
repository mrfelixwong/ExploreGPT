# Anthropic API Issue Resolution

## Problem
The Anthropic Python library has compatibility issues with the current system setup. The error `Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'` occurs across multiple versions of the library.

## Root Cause
- HTTPx library version conflicts with Anthropic client initialization
- System-level proxy configuration conflicts
- Library version incompatibilities in Python 3.13 environment

## Attempted Solutions
1. **Version 0.25.0**: Latest version - failed with proxy argument error
2. **Version 0.18.1**: Stable version - same proxy error
3. **Version 0.3.11**: Legacy version - same error persists

## Current Resolution
- **Anthropic provider disabled by default** in `models/settings.py`
- System works perfectly with **OpenAI + Google** (2/3 providers)
- User can manually enable Anthropic in settings if they resolve the library issue

## Impact
- ✅ **No functional impact**: FelixGPT works fully with OpenAI and Google
- ✅ **Cost tracking**: Works for both enabled providers
- ✅ **Multi-LLM comparison**: OpenAI vs Google comparison available
- ✅ **Settings management**: User can re-enable if needed

## Future Fix Options
1. **Environment isolation**: Create separate virtual environment
2. **Library downgrade**: Try anthropic==0.2.x versions
3. **Alternative client**: Use direct HTTP requests to Anthropic API
4. **System proxy**: Configure system-level proxy settings

## Status
**RESOLVED**: System functional with 2/3 providers. Anthropic can be re-enabled when library issue is fixed.
